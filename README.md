Eclipse Ease Help Generator for Java 11 (Partially implemented)

It is basically a migration of the Help Generator for Eclipse Ease, (https://git.eclipse.org/c/ease/org.eclipse.ease.scripts.git/) to Java 11.

It is recommended to create a new implementation of the help generator, because Java 11 API is very different to previous one.
